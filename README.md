I have Used rails controller action to render html pages.

To call api I have used rest api. for that I have used 'rest-client' gem.

At front end, I have used jquery to manupulate DOM based on api respnse.

search by will work in conjunction with search text

written rspec for create provider with validation, search/sort functionality, show page
